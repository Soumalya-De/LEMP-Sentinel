# Temporary Trivy suppressions
# Reason: The following libxml2 CVEs are present in the base Alpine image used by the local PHP image.
# These are upstream distro/package issues and will be remediated by updating the base image when a fixed package is available.
# Keep this suppression in the repo only until the base image is upgraded and CI passes without it.

# libxml2: Heap UAF -> fixed in 2.13.9-r0
CVE-2025-49794

# libxml: Type confusion DoS
CVE-2025-49796

# libxml: Null pointer dereference DoS
CVE-2025-49795

# libxml2: Integer overflow (xmlBuildQName) -> stack buffer overflow
CVE-2025-6021

# TODO: Remove entries above after upgrading `PHP_BASE_IMAGE` / underlying Alpine image and reconfirm CI# Add SHA256 IDs or vulnerability IDs (e.g., CVE-XXXX-YYYY) to suppress known/acceptable findings.
# Include a rationale above each rule and a link to an issue/PR tracking remediation.
# Example:
#
# # alpine:3.18 busybox CVE that does not affect our usage path
# CVE-2023-12345
